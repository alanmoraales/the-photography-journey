#### Introduction

As this is my first article, I wanna start by introducing myself
and this blog. My name is Alan, my history with photography starts in 2016 when
I went to the zoo to take some pictures of animals for a school project. Within
a year, it became something important in my life.

In early 2020, I was working in street and portrait photography, and when
the pandemic came, I knew I was not going to be able to keep doing it.
Stuck at home, I struggled to find new things to photograph,
I spend months exploring and taking a lot of pictures. By the end,
I realized that I had found something great, and that those new photos allowed me to
communicate more than just interesting moments,
something that I was looking to do before the Covid.

Welcome to The Photography Journey, in this blog I will
try to share some of the ideas I found in the last year, things I've learnt through all
this years, and what I'll be learning in the years to come.
Hopefully, it will help you in some way.

Let's start by introducing the idea that inspired me to start this project.

#### The two halves of life

Popularized by Carl Jung, the two halves of life says that a human life,
like a day, has its morning and its evening, each one with its tasks and goals.

The first half of life is spent building our sense of identity,
importance, and security, your ego structure. In the second half,
the ego still has a place, but now in the service of the
true self or soul, your inner and inherent identity. Your ego is
the container that holds you all together, so now its strength
is an advantage.

The transition between the morning and the evening starts when
you realize that your conscious self is not all of you, but only
the acceptable you. This often comes with a big failure or a
significant lost.

> _For what was great in the morning will be of little importance in the evening, and what in the morning was true will at evening become a lie._

#### The two halves of the creative journey

I heard of the two halves from Sean Tucker, he's one of the photographers who had inspired me
since I met him a few years ago. In his video [_The Two Halves of your Creative Journey_](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwipta_NwcDyAhXOUt8KHS6LDNUQwqsBegQICRAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DHDu9E-utgqw&usg=AOvVaw2zTlujpTztP8ZnC3g7Rjpz), Sean talks
about this idea from a creative perspective, he says that in our creative journey, we're also gonna
face the morning and the evening.

During the morning, we learn the basis of our area (photography in my case), the different
techniques and formalities, exploring every one of them, and every variant of our interest with the
goals of stablish our own style. We look for perfection, visibility and recognition.

In the evening, we realize that what we believed is a lie. We use all the things learnt and built in the
morning in order to create meaningful stuff, with the only purpose of fulfil ourselves.

#### My own journey

When it comes to my own journey, I have no doubt that I'm just
starting the morning. I recently took a course about visual narrative,
and as soon as I can safely return to the streets, I'm gonna start
making the kind of photographic series I learnt there. I still have
a lot to learn and explore, like for example buying a camera
(I photograph with my smartphone for now), printing and selling my
work or take photos of the Milky Way.

I don't know if in a few months or years, this blog will still exist,
but I do know that this is what I wanna try now. I had the fortune to
met photography early in my life and with time I'll find the lines to
drive myself into a wonderful evening.

#### Conclusions

Where are you in your creative journey? Either you're in the morning
or the evening, it doesn't matter. The important thing here is not
try to rush it, each one of the two phases have its own purpose, and
you're gonna get there. So slow down a moment, enjoy the view, the sounds,
and be happy, because the day it's just starting.
