#### Introduction

As this is my first article, I wanna start by introducing myself
and this blog. My name is Alan, I started taking photos four
years ago because of a school project (maybe I can tell that story later),
but it quickly became something important in my life.
In early 2020, I decided to try make some money by taking portraits
of people, but after a few sessions, I realized that I wasn't getting
the same satisfaction as if I just take photos of my friends or
street photography. Then the quarantine came, I took advantage
and cancel the last sessions I had pending.

Something good about all this Covid crisis is that I had some time
to think about what I really want to do with my photography.
I haven't decided everything yet, but one of the things I want
to do is to communicate more with my photos, and I think this blog
will help me get there.

Welcome to The Photography Journey, in this first entry I will
try to share with you some ideas I found in the last year, and
that inspired me to start this project. Hoppefully, it will help
you in some way.

#### The two halves of life

The idea of the two halves of life was popularized by Carl Jung,
a psychologist, also known as founder of the school of analytical
psychology. It says that a human life, like a day, has its morning
and its evening, each one with its tasks and goals.

The first half of life is spent building our sense of identity,
importance, and security, your ego structure. In the second half of
life, the ego still has a place, but now in the service of the
True Self or soul, your inner and inherent identity. Your ego is
the container that holds you all together, so now its strength
is an advantage.

The transition between the morning and the evening starts when
you realize that your conscious self is not all of you, but only
the acceptable you. This often comes with a big failure or a
significant lost.

#### My own journey

When it comes to my own journey, I have no doubt that I'm just
starting the morning. I recently took a course about visual narrative,
and as soon as I can safetly return to the streets, I'm gonna start
making the kind of photographic series I learnt there. I still have
a lot to learn and explore, like for example buying a camera
(I photograph with my smarphone for now), printing and selling my
work or take photos of the Milky Way.

I don't know if in a few months or years, this blog will still exist,
but I do know that this is what I wanna try now. I had the fortune to
met photography early in my life and with time I'll find the lines to
drive myself into a wonderful evening.

#### Conclusions

Where are you in your creative journey? Either you're in the morning
or the evening, it doesn't matter. The important thing here is to not
try to rush it, each one of the two phases have its own porpuse, and
you're gonna get there. So slow down a moment, enjoy the view, the sounds,
and be happy, because the day it's just starting.
